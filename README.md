# gSTED-sFCS

Python-based software for our optical measurement system.

## How this project works:

#### <u>GUI</u>

1. `.ui` files are created graphically using Qt Designer, and are dynamically compiled into Python from within the `gui.py` module.

2. Signals/slots (similar to callbacks) are coded as methods for the classes that are named after the windows (`MainWindow`, `SettingsWindow`, etc.).

3. Finally, when running the project (`gSTEDsFCS.py`), a `MainWindow()` object is instantiated and the window is shown on screen.

#### <u>Implemetation</u>

1. The`./implementation` package contains everything other than the most basic GUI - any button press triggers a slot in `gui.py` which in turn calls a function from the implementation. In this way the GUI is completely seperated from the implementation and the physical devices.

#### <u>Physical Device Control</u>

1. The `devices.py` module contains a high-level API for communicating with the instruments, some of the classes being subclassed from the more general `drivers.py`, where existing packages (pyVISA, nidaqmx, instrumental etc.) are also imported.

## What's here/Noteworthy files:

- `./gSTEDsFCS.e4p` - 'eric IDE' project file, which nicely ties everything together.

- `./gui/gui.py` - GUI module, containing strictly user interaction signals and slots, the slots implemented in `logic.py`.

- `./implementation/logic.py` - general implementations, slowly taking shape when things are moved to seperate modules. Currently contains mostly implementations of the main application stuff (`App()` class) and the GUI windows (i.e. `MainWin()` class).

- `./implementation/devices.py` - module implementing front-end device interaction with `logic.py` and back-end driver communication with physical instruments through subclassing driver implementations in `drivers.py`

- `./implementation/constants.py` - constants used across the project.

- `./settings/default_settings.csv` - default setting file, initial values for all GUI forms.

## Dependencies/Imports:

- Python 3.8.6 (some dependencies may not support newer versions yet, e.g. QScintilla does not support python 3.9 yet)

- [PyQt5]([PyQt5 路 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)) - Qt-Python API, used for GUI and timers (**installed with Eric IDE**)

- pandas - currently used only for reading the settings out of laziness (overkill)

- matplotlib - used for plotting (currently only the camera, later the graphs)

- [pyVISA]([PyVISA 路 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyVISA/)) - communication with VISA-supported devices

- [nidaqmx]([nidaqmx 路 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nidaqmx/)) - communication with NI-DAQmx supported devices

- [DCx Camera interfaces](https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=ThorCam), [Instrumental-lib]([Instrumental-lib 路 PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Instrumental-lib/)), [nicelib](https://pypi.org/project/NiceLib/),  - communication with DC480 cameras

- [PyFtdi](https://eblot.github.io/pyftdi/installation.html) - communication with UM232, which is a usb port to the FPGA (TDC data)

## Installing Eric IDE on Windows:

Eric IDE is notoriously complicated to install properly. I've tries to make it easier with the following steps (assuming Python is installed and added to PATH):

1. [Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eric-ide/) Eric IDE distribution and extract to temporary folder.

2. In Command Prompt:
   
   * Go to a directory where you want to install Eric (along with a virtual environment), e.g. `cd c:\Python`
   
   * Create a virtual environment, e.g. `python -m venv eric_env`
   
   * Activate virtual environment, e.g. `eric_env\Scripts\activate.bat` (or `& .\activate` in powershell). `(eric_env)` should appear on left of text.
   
   * Install eric via pip e.g. `pip install eric-ide`, say `y` to all.
   
   * Run install.py from the distribution (still in the virtual environment) e.g. `python C:\temporary folder\eric6-20.10\install.py`
   
   * To have access to Qt Designer from within Eric IDE, copy the contents of `\eric_env\Lib\site-packages\qt5_applications\Qt\bin` into `\eric_env\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5\Qt\bin`

3. That's it, icons should appear on desktop.
